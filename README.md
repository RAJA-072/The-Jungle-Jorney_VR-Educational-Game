## Overview
This VR project focuses on gamified education in the field of biology, specifically exploring the concept of food chains. The project consists of three interactive modules designed to engage players while teaching them about ecosystems and food relationships.

## Modules

### 1. Simplified Ecosystem

In this module, players are tasked with catching butterflies in a vibrant ecosystem. This activity helps players understand the role of various organisms within a food chain and the importance of biodiversity.

### 2. Pond Ecosystem

Players assume the role of a frog navigating across a pond filled with lily pads. Each lily pad hosts an insect or organism. The objective is to leap only onto lily pads containing organisms that are part of the frog's food chain, reinforcing the concept of predation and food relationships.

### 3. Snake Environment
